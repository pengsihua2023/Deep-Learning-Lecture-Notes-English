## Reinforcement Learning



Reinforcement learning is a learning method that improves decision-making rules through continuous interaction with the environment using trial and error. At each step, the system makes a decision based on the state of the environment and receives rewards or punishments according to the feedback. Through long-term accumulation and adjustment, reinforcement learning can form an optimal decision-making strategy that maximizes overall rewards.

* **Importance**:
  Reinforcement Learning (RL), when combined with neural networks (e.g., DQN, Deep Q-Network), has shown excellent performance in game AI and robotic control.
  It is the core of AI decision-making, demonstrating the application of neural networks in dynamic environments.

* **Core Concept**:
  RL learns optimal strategies through trial and error. Neural networks (e.g., CNN or MLP) are used to estimate action values or policies.

* **Analogy**: Like “a game-playing AI” that learns to achieve the highest score through continuous attempts.

* **Applications**: Game AI (e.g., AlphaGo), robot navigation, autonomous driving.

## Mathematical Description of Reinforcement Learning

### Markov Decision Process (MDP)

Reinforcement learning is usually modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), denoted as:

\$\mathcal{M} = (\mathcal{S}, \mathcal{A}, P, R, \gamma)\$

where:

* \$\mathcal{S}\$: state space
* \$\mathcal{A}\$: action space
* \$P(s'|s,a)\$: state transition probability

$$
P(s'|s,a) = \Pr(S_{t+1} = s' \mid S_t = s, A_t = a)
$$

* \$R(s,a)\$: reward function

$$
R(s,a) = \mathbb{E}[r_{t+1} \mid S_t = s, A_t = a]
$$

* \$\gamma \in \[0,1]\$: discount factor, used to balance long-term and short-term rewards.

### Policy

The policy \$\pi\$ defines the probability distribution of choosing an action under a given state:

$$
\pi(a|s) = \Pr(A_t = a \mid S_t = s)
$$

### Return

The cumulative discounted reward from time step \$t\$:

$$
G_t = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \gamma^k R_{t+k+1}
$$

### Value Function

1. **State-Value Function**
   The expected return when in state \$s\$ under policy \$\pi\$:

   \$V^\pi(s) = \mathbb{E}\_\pi \left\[ G\_t \mid S\_t = s \right]\$

2. **Action-Value Function (Q-function)**
   The expected return when in state \$s\$ and taking action \$a\$ under policy \$\pi\$:

   \$Q^\pi(s,a) = \mathbb{E}\_\pi \left\[ G\_t \mid S\_t = s, A\_t = a \right]\$

### Bellman Equation

1. **Bellman Equation for the State-Value Function**:

$$
V^\pi(s) = \sum_{a \in \mathcal{A}} \pi(a|s) \sum_{s' \in \mathcal{S}} P(s'|s,a) \Big[ R(s,a) + \gamma V^\pi(s') \Big]
$$

2. **Bellman Equation for the Action-Value Function**:

$$
Q^\pi(s,a) = \sum_{s' \in \mathcal{S}} P(s'|s,a) \Big[ R(s,a) + \gamma \sum_{a' \in \mathcal{A}} \pi(a'|s') Q^\pi(s',a') \Big]
$$

---

## Optimality

The goal is to find the optimal policy \$\pi^\*\$ that maximizes the value function:

## Code

Here is a simplest PyTorch-based reinforcement learning (Reinforcement Learning, RL) example, using the DQN (Deep Q-Network) algorithm to perform node classification tasks in the CartPole-v1 environment. The code ensures simplicity and compliance. It uses real-time interactive data (generated by the agent’s interaction with the CartPole environment), satisfying the “real data” requirement. The results are demonstrated via reward curve visualization and evaluation on a test set. Below is the full code with detailed Chinese explanation translated into English.

### Code Explanation

#### 1. Code Objective
- **Task**: Train a DQN model in the CartPole-v1 environment to enable the agent to learn to balance a pole by pushing a cart left or right, maximizing the balance duration.
- **Environment**: CartPole-v1 is a classic reinforcement learning environment provided by OpenAI Gym. The agent observes a 4-dimensional state (cart position, cart velocity, pole angle, pole angular velocity) and chooses between 2 actions (push left or right). Each step of balance yields a reward of 1, up to a maximum of 500 (episode ends when the pole falls or 500 steps are reached).
- **Data**: Data is generated in real-time through agent-environment interactions (state, action, reward, next state), meeting the "real data" requirement.
- **Output**:
  - **Visualization**: Plot the reward curve for each episode during training, saved as `cartpole_rewards.png`, to show learning progress.
  - **Evaluation**: Test the model over 10 episodes and compute the average reward to reflect the policy's effectiveness.
- **Dependencies**: Requires `torch`, `gym`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib` (install with `pip install torch gym numpy matplotlib`).

#### 2. Code Structure and Functionality

##### (1) Import Libraries
```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

  - `numpy`: Handles array operations and data conversion.
  - `matplotlib`: Plots the reward curve.
  - `collections.deque`: Implements the experience replay buffer.
  - `random`: Supports random action selection for the ε-greedy policy.

##### (2) DQN Model
```python
class DQN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, state_dim, action_dim):
        super(DQN, self).__init__()
        self.net = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(state_dim, 64),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(64, 64),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(64, action_dim)
        )
    
    def forward(self, x):
        return self.net(x)
```
- **Functionality**: Defines the DQN model, a simple three-layer multilayer perceptron (MLP).
- **Input**: `state_dim=4` (CartPole state dimensions: cart position, cart velocity, pole angle, pole angular velocity).
- **Output**: `action_dim=2` (Q-values for actions: push left, push right).
- **Structure**: 4D input → 64D (ReLU activation) → 64D (ReLU activation) → 2D output.
- **Purpose**: Predicts Q-values (expected future rewards) for each action based on the state, selecting the action with the highest Q-value.

##### (3) Experience Replay Buffer
```python
class ReplayBuffer:
    def __init__(self, capacity):
        self.buffer = deque(maxlen=capacity)
    
    def push(self, state, action, reward, next_state, done):
        self.buffer.append((state, action, reward, next_state, done))
    
    def sample(self, batch_size):
        state, action, reward, next_state, done = zip(*random.sample(self.buffer, batch_size))
        return (np.array(state), np.array(action), np.array(reward),
                np.array(next_state), np.array(done))
    
    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.buffer)
```
- **Functionality**: Implements experience replay to store interaction data and sample randomly, reducing temporal correlation and improving training stability.
- **Methods**:
  - `push`: Stores a single interaction tuple (state, action, reward, next state, done).
  - `sample`: Randomly samples `batch_size` experiences for training.
  - `__len__`: Returns the current buffer size.
- **Parameter**: `capacity=10000`, the buffer stores up to 10,000 experiences, overwriting old data when full.

##### (4) Train DQN
```python
def train_dqn(env, model, episodes=300, gamma=0.99, epsilon_start=1.0, epsilon_end=0.02, epsilon_decay=0.995, batch_size=32, buffer_capacity=10000):
```
- **Functionality**: Trains the DQN model to learn an optimal policy through environment interactions.
- **Parameters**:
  - `episodes=300`: Train for 300 episodes (each episode starts with a reset environment and ends when the pole falls or 500 steps are reached).
  - `gamma=0.99`: Discount factor, balancing immediate and future rewards.
  - `epsilon_start=1.0, epsilon_end=0.02, epsilon_decay=0.995`: ε-greedy policy, exploration rate decays from 1.0 (fully random) to 0.02.
  - `batch_size=32`: Sample 32 experiences per training step.
  - `buffer_capacity=10000`: Experience buffer capacity.
- **Training Process**:
  1. Reset the environment to obtain the initial state.
  2. Select an action using the ε-greedy policy (random action with probability ε, otherwise choose the action with the highest Q-value).
  3. Execute the action, obtain the reward, next state, and done flag, and store in the buffer.
  4. If the buffer is sufficiently large, sample 32 experiences randomly, compute target Q-values (`reward + γ * max(next_Q)`).
  5. Optimize the model using MSE loss and update parameters.
  6. Accumulate episode rewards, decay ε, and print rewards and ε every 50 episodes.

##### (5) Evaluate Model
```python
def evaluate_model(model, env, episodes=10):
```
- **Functionality**: Tests the trained model over 10 episodes, computing the average reward.
- **Process**:
  - Disable exploration (ε=0), selecting the action with the highest Q-value.
  - Each episode starts with a reset environment, accumulating rewards until termination.
  - Output the average reward over 10 episodes.
- **Evaluation Metric**: In CartPole-v1, a reward close to 500 indicates an excellent model, while 200+ indicates good performance.

##### (6) Visualize Reward Curve
```python
def plot_rewards(rewards, title="训练回合奖励曲线"):
```
- **Functionality**: Plots the reward curve for each episode during training, saved as `cartpole_rewards.png`.
- **Content**:
  - X-axis: Episode number (1 to 300).
  - Y-axis: Total reward per episode (maximum 500).
  - Trend: An upward trend indicates the model is learning a better policy.
- **Significance**: Visually demonstrates the DQN's learning progress, ideally showing a curve approaching high values.

##### (7) Main Function
```python
def main():
    global device
    device = torch.device('cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu')
    
    env = gym.make('CartPole-v1')
    state_dim = env.observation_space.shape[0]
    action_dim = env.action_space.n
    model = DQN(state_dim, action_dim).to(device)
    
    print("开始训练DQN...")
    rewards = train_dqn(env, model, episodes=300)
    
    print("\n评估DQN...")
    eval_rewards = evaluate_model(model, env, episodes=10)
    
    plot_rewards(rewards)
    
    env.close()
```
- **Functionality**: Program entry point, initializes the environment and model, executes training, evaluation, and visualization.
- **Process**:
  1. Check GPU availability and set the device (`cuda` or `cpu`).
  2. Create the CartPole-v1 environment (4D state, 2 actions).
  3. Initialize the DQN model (4→64→64→2).
  4. Train for 300 episodes, recording rewards.
  5. Test over 10 episodes and output the average reward.
  6. Plot the reward curve and close the environment.

---

### Execution Results
- **Training Output**: Prints every 50 episodes, showing episode number, total reward, and ε value, e.g.:
  ```
  Episode [50/300], Reward: 25.00, Epsilon: 0.7798
  Episode [100/300], Reward: 60.00, Epsilon: 0.6050
  ...
  ```
- **Test Output**: Average reward over 10 test episodes, e.g.:
  ```
  Average reward over 10 test episodes: 280.50
  ```
  (Reward of 200+ indicates good performance, close to 500 indicates excellent performance).
- **Visualization**: Generates `cartpole_rewards.png`, showing the reward curve over episodes, saved in the working directory, viewable with an image viewer.
- **Significance**: An upward reward curve indicates the model is learning to balance the pole, and test rewards reflect the policy's actual performance.

---

### Notes
- **Real Data**: Data is generated in real-time through agent interactions with the CartPole environment (states, actions, rewards, etc.), meeting the "real data" requirement.
- **Model Simplicity**: The DQN uses a small MLP (64-unit hidden layers), suitable for demonstrating reinforcement learning concepts; more complex networks or algorithms (e.g., Double DQN) can be used in practical applications.
- **Dependencies**:
  - Install command:
    ```bash
    pip install torch gym numpy matplotlib
    ```
  - The CartPole-v1 environment is provided by Gym, requiring no additional datasets.
- **Run Time**: Training takes approximately 2-5 minutes (depending on hardware), runs on CPU, faster on GPU.
- **Extensions**:
  - For other environments (e.g., LunarLander-v2, Atari games), please specify.
  - For specific evaluation metrics (e.g., success rate, variance), further customization is possible.

---

### Improvements and Differences
Compared to previous code, this version:
- Reduces training episodes (500 → 300) for faster execution.
- Adjusts network structure (hidden layers from 128 → 64 units, batch_size from 64 → 32) for a lighter model.
- Optimizes ε decay (epsilon_end from 0.01 → 0.02) to maintain some exploration.
- Simplifies Chinese output, clearly displaying episode rewards and ε values.
