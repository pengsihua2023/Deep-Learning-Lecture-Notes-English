# Advanced: Large model fine tuning
## ðŸ“– Introduction
Large Model Fine-Tuning refers to the process of further training large-scale pre-trained models (e.g., BERT, LLaMA, GPT) on data specific to a particular task or domain, adjusting model parameters to improve performance on the target task. Fine-tuning leverages the general knowledge of pre-trained models, combining it with a small amount of task-specific data to significantly reduce training costs and data requirements while enhancing model performance in specific scenarios.

## ðŸ“– Core Concepts of Fine-Tuning
- **Pre-trained Model**: A model trained on large-scale general datasets (e.g., Wikipedia, ImageNet), capturing universal language or visual features.
- **Fine-Tuning Objective**: Adapt the pre-trained model to a specific task (e.g., text classification, image recognition) or domain (e.g., medical, financial) by adjusting some or all parameters.
- **Data Efficiency**: Fine-tuning typically requires only a small amount of labeled data, saving resources compared to training from scratch.
- **Overfitting Risk**: Due to the large number of parameters in large models, fine-tuning with insufficient data can lead to overfitting.

## ðŸ“– Main Fine-Tuning Techniques
1. **Full Fine-Tuning**:
   - **Description**: Adjusts all parameters of the pre-trained model to optimize the entire network for the target task.
   - **Applicable Scenarios**: When there is sufficient target task data and the task differs significantly from the pre-training data.
   - **Advantages**: Deep adaptation to the target task, leading to significant performance improvements.
   - **Disadvantages**: High computational cost and increased risk of overfitting.
   - **Example**: Fine-tuning BERT on medical text data for disease classification.

2. **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)**:
   - **Description**: Adjusts only a small subset of parameters (e.g., additional adapter layers or bias terms) while keeping most pre-trained parameters frozen.
   - **Methods**:
     - **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)**: Adds trainable low-rank update matrices without modifying original weights.
     - **Adapter Tuning**: Inserts small adapter modules between model layers, training only these modules.
     - **Prompt Tuning**: Learns task-specific prompt vectors to guide model outputs.
   - **Applicable Scenarios**: Limited data, constrained computational resources, or rapid adaptation to multiple tasks.
   - **Advantages**: Low computational and storage costs, suitable for multi-task deployment.
   - **Disadvantages**: Performance may be slightly inferior to full fine-tuning.
   - **Example**: Using LoRA to fine-tune LLaMA for question-answering tasks.

3. **Feature-Based Fine-Tuning**:
   - **Description**: Freezes some layers of the pre-trained model (typically lower-level feature extraction layers) and trains only the top layers (e.g., classification head).
   - **Applicable Scenarios**: When the target task is highly related to the pre-training task and data is scarce.
   - **Advantages**: Low computational cost and fast training.
   - **Disadvantages**: Limited model adaptation capability.
   - **Example**: Freezing ResNetâ€™s convolutional layers and training only the fully connected layer for image classification.

4. **Instruction Fine-Tuning**:
   - **Description**: Fine-tunes on datasets containing instruction-input-output triplets to improve the modelâ€™s ability to follow user instructions.
   - **Applicable Scenarios**: Dialogue systems, generative tasks (e.g., ChatGPT).
   - **Advantages**: Enhances the modelâ€™s understanding and generation of complex instructions.
   - **Disadvantages**: Requires high-quality instruction datasets.
   - **Example**: Fine-tuning GPT on dialogue data to generate more natural responses.

5. **Domain-Adaptive Fine-Tuning**:
   - **Description**: Further pre-trains on unlabeled or sparsely labeled data from the target domain to bridge the domain gap before task-specific fine-tuning.
   - **Applicable Scenarios**: When the source and target domains have significant distribution differences (e.g., general language model to legal texts).
   - **Advantages**: Improves model adaptation to the target domain.
   - **Disadvantages**: Requires domain-specific data, potentially increasing preprocessing costs.
   - **Example**: Continuing pre-training BERT on legal documents before fine-tuning for legal text classification.

## ðŸ“– Fine-Tuning Workflow
1. **Select Pre-trained Model**: Choose an appropriate model based on the task type (e.g., BERT for NLP, ResNet for computer vision).
2. **Prepare Dataset**: Collect labeled data for the target task, applying data augmentation if necessary.
3. **Modify Model Structure**: Adjust the modelâ€™s output layer (e.g., classification head) based on task requirements.
4. **Set Hyperparameters**: Select learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, etc., typically using a small learning rate (e.g., 1e-5) to avoid disrupting pre-trained knowledge.
5. **Train and Evaluate**: Fine-tune on the training set, tune hyperparameters on the validation set, and evaluate performance on the test set.
6. **Deploy**: Deploy the fine-tuned model to the production environment.

## ðŸ“– Application Scenarios
- **Natural Language Processing**: Text classification, named entity recognition, machine translation, dialogue systems.
- **Computer Vision**: Image classification, object detection, image segmentation.
- **Cross-Domain Tasks**: Medical image diagnosis, legal document analysis, financial risk modeling.

## ðŸ“– Advantages and Challenges
- **Advantages**:
  - Leverages universal knowledge from pre-trained models, reducing data and computational requirements.
  - Quickly adapts to specific tasks, improving performance.
  - Highly flexible, applicable to various tasks and domains.
- **Challenges**:
  - **Overfitting**: Models may overfit when data is insufficient.
  - **Computational Resources**: Full fine-tuning requires significant GPU/TPU resources.
  - **Catastrophic Forgetting**: Fine-tuning may degrade the pre-trained modelâ€™s general knowledge.
  - **Domain Gap**: Large differences between the source model and target task may require additional processing.

## ðŸ“– Simple Code Example (Fine-Tuning with PyTorch and LoRA)
Below is an example of fine-tuning a pre-trained BERT model for text classification using LoRA, based on Hugging Faceâ€™s `transformers` library.
## Code
```python
import torch
from transformers import BertForSequenceClassification, BertTokenizer, Trainer, TrainingArguments
from datasets import load_dataset
from peft import LoraConfig, get_peft_model

# Load pre-trained BERT model and tokenizer
model_name = "bert-base-uncased"
tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_name, num_labels=2)  # Assume binary classification task

# Load dataset (example uses IMDB dataset)
dataset = load_dataset("imdb")
def tokenize_function(examples):
    return tokenizer(examples["text"], padding="max_length", truncation=True, max_length=128)
tokenized_datasets = dataset.map(tokenize_function, batched=True)

# Configure LoRA
lora_config = LoraConfig(
    r=8,  # Rank of low-rank matrices
    lora_alpha=16,  # Scaling factor
    target_modules=["query", "value"],  # Fine-tune attention modules of BERT
    lora_dropout=0.1,
)
model = get_peft_model(model, lora_config)

# Set training parameters
training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir="./results",
    evaluation_strategy="epoch",
    learning_rate=2e-5,
    per_device_train_batch_size=16,
    per_device_eval_batch_size=16,
    num_train_epochs=3,
    weight_decay=0.01,
    save_strategy="epoch",
    load_best_model_at_end=True,
)

# Create Trainer
trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=tokenized_datasets["train"].select(range(1000)),  # Reduce data size to speed up example
    eval_dataset=tokenized_datasets["test"].select(range(200)),
)

# Start fine-tuning
print("Starting LoRA Fine-Tuning...")
trainer.train()

# Evaluate model
eval_results = trainer.evaluate()
print(f"Evaluation Results: {eval_results}")

```
