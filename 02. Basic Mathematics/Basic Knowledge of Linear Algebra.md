# Basic Knowledge of Linear Algebra
## Key Points to Master Linear Algebra in Deep Learning
Linear algebra is one of the foundational mathematical tools for deep learning, enabling us to understand data representation, model parameters, and computational processes. In deep learning, neural networks fundamentally process data through matrix and vector operations. For example, input data can be represented as vectors or matrices, weight parameters are in matrix form, and backpropagation involves matrix multiplication and derivative calculations. Without a solid foundation in linear algebra, it’s challenging to deeply understand a model’s internal mechanisms or debug issues. Below, I will discuss the core concepts to master, organized from basic to advanced, explaining their importance and applications in deep learning with examples. The content is based on a synthesis of authoritative sources, such as the book *Deep Learning* and related online tutorials.

### 📖 1. **Basic Elements: Scalars, Vectors, Matrices, and Tensors**
   - **Concept Explanation**: A scalar is a single number (e.g., learning rate); a vector is a one-dimensional array (e.g., feature vector); a matrix is a two-dimensional array (e.g., weight matrix); a tensor is a higher-dimensional array (e.g., image batch data).
   - **Why Important**: Deep learning data is typically multidimensional, and tensors are the core data structure in frameworks like PyTorch or TensorFlow. Understanding these helps efficiently handle batch data.
   - **Deep Learning Application**: Input images can be represented as 3D tensors (height × width × channels), and neural network layers transform this data via matrix multiplication.
   - **Learning Tips**: Get familiar with indexing, shapes, and broadcasting rules.

#### Code Example:
```python
import numpy as np
# Scalar
scalar = 5.0
print("Scalar:", scalar)
# Vector (1D array)
vector = np.array([1, 2, 3])
print("Vector:", vector)
# Matrix (2D array)
matrix = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
print("Matrix:\n", matrix)
# Tensor (3D array, e.g., image data)
tensor = np.random.rand(2, 3, 3)  # batch × height × width
print("Tensor shape:", tensor.shape)
```

#### Application Note: In deep learning, tensors represent batch data, such as PyTorch’s Tensor.

### 📖 2. **Vector Operations**
   - **Concept Explanation**: Includes vector addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication, dot product (inner product), cross product (outer product), and norms (e.g., L1 norm, L2 norm/Euclidean norm).
   - **Why Important**: Vector operations are used to compute similarity, distance, and regularization. The L2 norm is often used in weight decay (L2 regularization) to prevent overfitting.
   - **Deep Learning Application**: Cosine similarity (based on dot product) is used in embedding spaces; norms measure update steps in gradient descent.
   - **Learning Tips**: Understand norm formulas and practice with NumPy.

#### Code Example:
```python
import numpy as np
v1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])
v2 = np.array([4, 5, 6])
# Addition
addition = v1 + v2
print("Addition:", addition)
# Dot product (inner product)
dot_product = np.dot(v1, v2)
print("Dot product:", dot_product)
# L2 norm
norm_l2 = np.linalg.norm(v1)
print("L2 Norm:", norm_l2)
# Cosine similarity (based on dot product, for embedding spaces)
cosine_sim = np.dot(v1, v2) / (np.linalg.norm(v1) * np.linalg.norm(v2))
print("Cosine similarity:", cosine_sim)
```

#### Application Note: L2 norm is used for regularization, and cosine similarity is used to compute word embedding similarity.

### 📖 3. **Matrix Operations**
   - **Concept Explanation**: Matrix addition, subtraction, multiplication (requires dimension compatibility, e.g., an m×n matrix times an n×p matrix yields an m×p matrix), transpose, inverse, and determinant.
   - **Why Important**: Matrix multiplication is the core operation in neural network forward propagation, e.g., output = input × weights + bias.
   - **Deep Learning Application**: Convolutional layers are essentially variants of matrix multiplication; attention mechanisms (e.g., in Transformers) rely on matrix multiplication for self-attention.
   - **Learning Tips**: Remember that matrix multiplication is non-commutative (AB ≠ BA), and understand pseudoinverse for non-invertible matrices.

#### Code Example:
```python
import numpy as np
A = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
B = np.array([[5, 6], [7, 8]])
# Addition
addition = A + B
print("Addition:\n", addition)
# Matrix multiplication (simulating neural network layer: output = input @ weights)
multiplication = np.dot(A, B)  # or A @ B
print("Multiplication:\n", multiplication)
# Transpose
transpose = A.T
print("Transpose:\n", transpose)
# Inverse (assuming invertible)
inverse = np.linalg.inv(A)
print("Inverse:\n", inverse)
# Determinant
determinant = np.linalg.det(A)
print("Determinant:", determinant)
```

#### Application Note: Matrix multiplication is central to forward propagation, such as in fully connected layers.

### 📖 4. **Vector Spaces and Linear Independence**
   - **Concept Explanation**: Vector spaces (subspaces), basis, dimension, rank, linear independence (a set of vectors cannot be expressed as linear combinations of each other), singular matrices (rank-deficient).
   - **Why Important**: Helps understand data dimensionality and redundancy; high-dimensional data may be linearly dependent, leading to model instability.
   - **Deep Learning Application**: In PCA dimensionality reduction, rank identifies principal components; linear independence ensures non-redundant features, improving model efficiency.
   - **Learning Tips**: Compute matrix rank using row echelon form.

#### Code Example:
```python
import numpy as np
# Matrix rank (checking linear independence)
matrix = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])  # Linearly dependent, rank < 3
rank = np.linalg.matrix_rank(matrix)
print("Matrix rank:", rank)
# Check linear independence (rank equals number of vectors)
vectors = np.array([[1, 0], [0, 1]])  # Independent
if np.linalg.matrix_rank(vectors.T) == vectors.shape[0]:
    print("Vectors are linearly independent")
else:
    print("Vectors are linearly dependent")
```

#### Application Note: Rank is used to detect feature redundancy, e.g., before PCA.

### 📖 5. **Linear Transformations**
   - **Concept Explanation**: Transformations represented by matrices, such as rotation, scaling, projection; kernel and image.
   - **Why Important**: Neural network layers can be viewed as sequences of linear transformations followed by nonlinear activation functions.
   - **Deep Learning Application**: Fully connected layers are linear transformations; understanding transformations helps analyze a model’s expressive power.
   - **Learning Tips**: Visualize 2D transformations, e.g., rotation matrix [[cosθ, -sinθ], [sinθ, cosθ]].

#### Code Example:
```python
import numpy as np
# Rotation matrix (linear transformation example, 90-degree rotation)
theta = np.pi / 2  # 90 degrees
rotation_matrix = np.array([[np.cos(theta), -np.sin(theta)], [np.sin(theta), np.cos(theta)]])
# Apply transformation to a vector
vector = np.array([1, 0])
transformed = np.dot(rotation_matrix, vector)
print("Original vector:", vector)
print("Transformed vector:", transformed)
```

#### Application Note: Simulates the linear part of a neural network layer, followed by an activation function.

### 📖 6. **Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors**
   - **Concept Explanation**: For a matrix A, vectors v (eigenvectors) and scalars λ (eigenvalues) satisfying A v = λ v; eigendecomposition.
   - **Why Important**: Used to analyze a matrix’s “stretching” behavior, aiding optimization and training stability.
   - **Deep Learning Application**: In PCA, eigenvalues indicate variance contribution; used in spectral clustering or optimization algorithms; Hessian matrix eigenvalues help analyze loss function curvature.
   - **Learning Tips**: Compute eigenvalues for simple matrices and verify using the SymPy library.

#### Code Example:
```python
import numpy as np
A = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
# Compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors
eigenvalues, eigenvectors = np.linalg.eig(A)
print("Eigenvalues:", eigenvalues)
print("Eigenvectors:\n", eigenvectors)
# Verify: A v = λ v
for i in range(len(eigenvalues)):
    lambda_v = eigenvalues[i] * eigenvectors[:, i]
    A_v = np.dot(A, eigenvectors[:, i])
    print(f"Verification for eigenvalue {i}: A v ≈ λ v:", np.allclose(A_v, lambda_v))
```

#### Application Note: Used to analyze loss function curvature or variance explanation in PCA.

### 📖 7. **Matrix Decomposition**
   - **Concept Explanation**: Singular Value Decomposition (SVD: A = U Σ V^T), Principal Component Analysis (PCA, based on SVD), QR decomposition, LU decomposition.
   - **Why Important**: Decompositions simplify computations and are used for dimensionality reduction and numerical stability.
   - **Deep Learning Application**: SVD is used for model compression (e.g., low-rank approximation of weight matrices); PCA preprocesses data to reduce dimensionality; QR is used for orthogonal weight initialization.
   - **Learning Tips**: Understand the geometric meaning of SVD (rotation, scaling, rotation).

#### Code Example:
```python
import numpy as np
A = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]])  # Non-square matrix
# Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
U, S, Vt = np.linalg.svd(A, full_matrices=False)
print("U:\n", U)
print("Singular values:", S)
print("Vt:\n", Vt)
# Reconstruct matrix (verify)
reconstructed = np.dot(U * S, Vt)
print("Reconstructed matrix ≈ Original:", np.allclose(reconstructed, A))
# PCA example (simple dimensionality reduction)
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
pca = PCA(n_components=1)
reduced = pca.fit_transform(A)
print("PCA reduced:\n", reduced)
```

#### Application Note: SVD is used for model compression, PCA for data preprocessing. Note: This example uses sklearn.decomposition for PCA; skip or install sklearn if unavailable.

### 📖 8. **Other Advanced Topics**
   - **Orthogonality and Norms**: Orthogonal matrices (Q^T Q = I), Frobenius norm.
   - **Why Important**: Orthogonal initialization prevents gradient explosion/vanishing.
   - **Application**: Used in RNNs or Transformers to stabilize training.
   - **Learning Tips**: Prioritize core operations first, then explore these if time allows.

#### Code Example:
```python
import numpy as np
# Orthogonal matrix (e.g., identity matrix)
Q = np.eye(2)  # or obtain from QR decomposition
print("Orthogonal matrix Q:\n", Q)
print("Q^T Q = I:", np.allclose(np.dot(Q.T, Q), np.eye(2)))
# Frobenius norm (matrix L2 norm)
matrix = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
frobenius_norm = np.linalg.norm(matrix, 'fro')
print("Frobenius norm:", frobenius_norm)
```

#### Application Note: Orthogonal matrices are used for weight initialization to prevent gradient issues.
