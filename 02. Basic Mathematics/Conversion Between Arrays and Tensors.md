## Mathematical Fundamentals: Conversion Between Arrays and Tensors

#### **1. In NumPy**
In `NumPy`, arrays and tensors are both represented by `numpy.ndarray`, so no explicit conversion is needed; they can be treated as tensors or arrays depending on the context.
- **From Array to Tensor**:
  - Any `NumPy` array can be directly used as a tensor because `ndarray` supports tensor operations (e.g., matrix multiplication, norm computation).
  - Example (a 4x3 array as a 2nd-order tensor):
    ```python
    import numpy as np
    arr = np.array([[0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1], [1, 1, 0]]) # 2D array
    print(arr.shape) # (4, 3)
    print(arr.ndim) # 2 (2nd-order tensor)
    # As a tensor: compute matrix multiplication
    result = np.dot(arr, arr.T) # 4x4 matrix
    print(result)
    ```
  - Here, `arr` is a 2D array and is directly used as a 2nd-order tensor without conversion.
- **From Tensor to Array**:
  - Tensors in `NumPy` are already stored as `ndarray`, so they can be used directly as arrays (e.g., for indexing, slicing, or statistics).
  - Example:
    ```python
    import numpy as np
    tensor = np.array([[0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1], [1, 1, 0]]) # 2nd-order tensor
    # As an array: extract the first row
    first_row = tensor[0, :] # [0 1 0]
    print(first_row)
    ```
- **Dimension Adjustment**:
  - The shape or rank of an array/tensor can be modified using `.reshape()` or `.expand_dims()`.
  - Example (1D array to 2D tensor):
    ```python
    import numpy as np
    arr_1d = np.array([1, 2, 3]) # 1D array (1st-order tensor)
    tensor_2d = arr_1d.reshape(1, 3) # 2D tensor (1x3 matrix)
    print(tensor_2d.shape) # (1, 3)
    print(tensor_2d.ndim) # 2
    ```

#### **2. In Deep Learning Frameworks (TensorFlow/PyTorch)**
In `TensorFlow` or `PyTorch`, tensors (e.g., `tf.Tensor` or `torch.Tensor`) are specialized objects that support features like automatic differentiation. Conversion between arrays and tensors requires explicit operations.
- **From NumPy Array to Tensor**:
  - `TensorFlow`:
    ```python
    import tensorflow as tf
    import numpy as np
    arr = np.array([[0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1], [1, 1, 0]]) # NumPy array
    tensor = tf.convert_to_tensor(arr) # Convert to tf.Tensor
    print(tensor.shape) # (4, 3)
    print(tensor.dtype) # int64
    ```
  - `PyTorch`:
    ```python
    import torch
    import numpy as np
    arr = np.array([[0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1], [1, 1, 0]]) # NumPy array
    tensor = torch.from_numpy(arr) # Convert to torch.Tensor
    print(tensor.shape) # torch.Size([4, 3])
    print(tensor.dtype) # torch.int64
    ```
- **From Tensor to NumPy Array**:
  - `TensorFlow`:
    ```python
    import tensorflow as tf
    tensor = tf.constant([[0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1], [1, 1, 0]]) # tf.Tensor
    arr = tensor.numpy() # Convert to NumPy array
    print(arr.shape) # (4, 3)
    ```
  - `PyTorch`:
    ```python
    import torch
    tensor = torch.tensor([[0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1], [1, 1, 0]]) # torch.Tensor
    arr = tensor.numpy() # Convert to NumPy array
    print(arr.shape) # (4, 3)
    ```
  - **Note**: In `PyTorch`, `.numpy()` requires the tensor to be on the CPU. If the tensor is on a GPU, call `.cpu()` first.
- **Considerations**:
  - Ensure data type compatibility during conversion (e.g., `int64`, `float32`).
  - Tensors may include additional properties (e.g., gradients for automatic differentiation), which arrays typically lack.

#### **3. Shape and Rank Conversion**
- The rank (dimensions) of arrays and tensors can be adjusted using reshaping (`reshape`) or dimension expansion (`expand_dims`).
- Example (1st-order to 3rd-order tensor):
  ```python
  import numpy as np
  arr_1d = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]) # 1D array (1st-order tensor)
  tensor_2d = arr_1d.reshape(2, 3) # 2nd-order tensor (2x3)
  tensor_3d = arr_1d.reshape(1, 2, 3) # 3rd-order tensor (1x2x3)
  print(tensor_2d.shape) # (2, 3)
  print(tensor_3d.shape) # (1, 2, 3)
  ```
- Reverse Conversion (Flattening a Tensor to an Array):
  ```python
  tensor_3d = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=(2, 3, 4)) # 3rd-order tensor
  arr_1d = tensor_3d.flatten() # Flatten to 1D array
  print(arr_1d.shape) # (24,)
  ```

### **4. Considerations in Conversion**
1. **Data Types**:
   - Ensure data type compatibility during conversion. For example, `NumPy`â€™s `int64` can be converted to `torch.int64`, but deep learning frameworks may require `float32` for computations.
   - Example:
     ```python
     import torch
     arr = np.array([[0, 1, 0]], dtype=np.int64)
     tensor = torch.from_numpy(arr).float() # Convert to float32
     print(tensor.dtype) # torch.float32
     ```
2. **Memory Sharing**:
   - In `NumPy` and `PyTorch`, `torch.from_numpy` creates a tensor that shares memory with the original array, so modifying one affects the other.
   - Example:
     ```python
     import numpy as np
     import torch
     arr = np.array([1, 2, 3])
     tensor = torch.from_numpy(arr)
     arr[0] = 99
     print(tensor) # tensor([99, 2, 3])
     ```
3. **Framework Limitations**:
   - `TensorFlow` and `PyTorch` tensors support automatic differentiation, while `NumPy` arrays do not. For gradient computations, use deep learning tensors.
   - Example:
     ```python
     import torch
     tensor = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], requires_grad=True) # Supports gradients
     ```
4. **Shape Consistency**:
   - Conversion does not alter the shape. For example, a 4x3 array remains `(4, 3)` after conversion to a tensor.

### **5. Summary**
- **Can Arrays and Tensors Be Converted?**:
  - **Yes**, in `NumPy`, arrays (`ndarray`) are directly used as tensors without explicit conversion. In deep learning frameworks, conversion is done using `tf.convert_to_tensor` or `torch.from_numpy` (array to tensor) and `.numpy()` (tensor to array).
- **In NumPy**:
  - Arrays and tensors are both `ndarray`. A 1D array is a 1st-order tensor (vector), a 2D array is a 2nd-order tensor (matrix), and a 3D array is a 3rd-order tensor.
  - A 4x3 array `[[0 1 0], [1 0 1], [0 0 1], [1 1 0]]` is a 2nd-order tensor, directly usable for tensor operations or convertible to deep learning tensors.
- **In Deep Learning Frameworks**:
  - Arrays can be converted to `tf.Tensor` or `torch.Tensor`, which support features like automatic differentiation. Tensors can be converted back to `NumPy` arrays.
