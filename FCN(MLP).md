## FCN(MLP)
**Fully Connected Neural Network (MLP)**

**Importance**: This is a foundational model in deep learning, and understanding it helps grasp core neural network concepts (e.g., neurons, weights, activation functions, gradient descent).  

**Core Concepts**:  
- A neural network consists of an input layer, hidden layers, and an output layer, functioning like neurons in the brain.  
- Each neuron receives inputs, computes a weighted sum, and passes it through an activation function (e.g., sigmoid or ReLU) to produce an output.  
- Training involves adjusting weights through "trial and error" to make predictions closer to actual values (using gradient descent).  
- Applications: House price prediction, classification tasks (e.g., determining if an image is a cat or a dog).  

**Why Teach**: MLP is the foundation of all deep learning models, helping students understand the core mechanisms of neural networks.
