## Layer Normalization of Input
### What is Layer Normalization?

Layer Normalization (LN) is a regularization technique used in deep learning to normalize the inputs of neural networks, especially suitable for Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Transformer models. Unlike Batch Normalization (BN), LN normalizes **the feature dimensions of a single sample** at each layer instead of across the batch. This makes LN insensitive to batch size, particularly suitable for small-batch or sequential tasks.

#### Core Principle

For the input $x \in \mathbb{R}^d$ of each sample ($d$ is the feature dimension, such as hidden layer size), LN performs the following steps:

**1. Compute mean and variance:**

* Mean: $\mu = \frac{1}{d} \sum_{i=1}^d x_i$

* Variance: $\sigma^2 = \frac{1}{d} \sum_{i=1}^d (x_i - \mu)^2$

**2. Normalization:**

$$
\hat{x}_i = \frac{x_i - \mu}{\sqrt{\sigma^2 + \epsilon}}
$$

* $\epsilon$ is a small constant to prevent division by zero.

**3. Scaling and shifting:**

$$
y_i = \gamma \hat{x}_i + \beta
$$

* $\gamma$ and $\beta$ are learnable parameters that control scaling and shifting.

- **Consistency between training and testing**: LN normalization is based on the feature dimensions of a single sample, without requiring global statistics during testing as in BN.  
- **Applicable scenarios**: LN performs well in sequence models (e.g., RNN, Transformer) or small-batch cases because it does not rely on batch statistics.  

#### Differences from BatchNorm
- **BN**: Normalizes each feature dimension across the batch, depends on batch size, suitable for CNN.  
- **LN**: Normalizes the feature dimensions of each sample, independent of batch size, suitable for RNN and Transformer.  
- **Computation axis**: BN normalizes along the batch axis, LN normalizes along the feature axis.  

#### Advantages
- **Independent of batch size**: Suitable for small-batch or single-sample inference (e.g., online learning).  
- **Stability**: Reduces internal covariate shift, accelerates training, and allows higher learning rates.  
- **Applicability**: Standard component in Transformers (e.g., BERT, GPT).  

#### Limitations
- **Computation overhead**: May slightly increase computation for high-dimensional features.  
- **Not suitable for some tasks**: BN usually outperforms LN in convolutional networks.

### Python Code Example

Below is a simple PyTorch example implementing Layer Normalization, based on the MNIST handwritten digit classification task. The code adds LN layers to a fully connected neural network, combined with Adam optimizer and early stopping (as described earlier).

```python

import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
from torchvision import datasets, transforms
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader

# Step 1: Define a neural network with LayerNorm

class LayerNormNet(nn.Module):
def **init**(self):
super(LayerNormNet, self).**init**()
self.fc1 = nn.Linear(28 \* 28, 128)  # Input: 28x28 pixels
self.ln1 = nn.LayerNorm(128)        # LayerNorm layer, normalize 128 features
self.fc2 = nn.Linear(128, 10)       # Output: 10 classes
self.relu = nn.ReLU()


def forward(self, x):
    x = x.view(-1, 28 * 28)  # Flatten input
    x = self.fc1(x)
    x = self.ln1(x)          # Apply LayerNorm
    x = self.relu(x)
    x = self.fc2(x)
    return x


# Step 2: Load MNIST dataset and split into train/validation

transform = transforms.ToTensor()
train\_dataset = datasets.MNIST(root='./data', train=True, download=True, transform=transform)
test\_dataset = datasets.MNIST(root='./data', train=False, transform=transform)
train\_size = int(0.8 \* len(train\_dataset))
val\_size = len(train\_dataset) - train\_size
train\_subset, val\_subset = torch.utils.data.random\_split(train\_dataset, \[train\_size, val\_size])
train\_loader = DataLoader(train\_subset, batch\_size=64, shuffle=True)
val\_loader = DataLoader(val\_subset, batch\_size=64)
test\_loader = DataLoader(test\_dataset, batch\_size=64)

# Step 3: Initialize model, loss function, and optimizer

model = LayerNormNet()
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

# Step 4: Early stopping class (reuse previous logic)

class EarlyStopping:
def **init**(self, patience=3, delta=0):
self.patience = patience
self.delta = delta
self.best\_loss = float('inf')
self.counter = 0
self.best\_model\_state = None
self.early\_stop = False


def __call__(self, val_loss, model):
    if val_loss < self.best_loss - self.delta:
        self.best_loss = val_loss
        self.best_model_state = model.state_dict()
        self.counter = 0
    else:
        self.counter += 1
        if self.counter >= self.patience:
            self.early_stop = True


# Step 5: Training and validation functions

def train(epoch):
model.train()
total\_loss = 0
for data, target in train\_loader:
optimizer.zero\_grad()
output = model(data)
loss = criterion(output, target)
loss.backward()
optimizer.step()
total\_loss += loss.item()
return total\_loss / len(train\_loader)

def validate():
model.eval()
val\_loss = 0
with torch.no\_grad():
for data, target in val\_loader:
output = model(data)
val\_loss += criterion(output, target).item()
return val\_loss / len(val\_loader)

# Step 6: Testing function

def test():
model.eval()
correct = 0
total = 0
with torch.no\_grad():
for data, target in test\_loader:
output = model(data)
\_, predicted = torch.max(output.data, 1)
total += target.size(0)
correct += (predicted == target).sum().item()
return 100. \* correct / total

# Step 7: Training loop with early stopping

early\_stopping = EarlyStopping(patience=3, delta=0.001)
epochs = 20
for epoch in range(1, epochs + 1):
train\_loss = train(epoch)
val\_loss = validate()
print(f'Epoch {epoch}, Train Loss: {train\_loss:.4f}, Val Loss: {val\_loss:.4f}')


early_stopping(val_loss, model)
if early_stopping.early_stop:
    print("Early stopping triggered!")
    break


# Restore best model

if early\_stopping.best\_model\_state:
model.load\_state\_dict(early\_stopping.best\_model\_state)
print("Restored best model from early stopping.")

# Step 8: Test best model

test\_accuracy = test()
print(f'Test Accuracy: {test\_accuracy:.2f}%')

```

### Code Explanation

1. **Model definition**:  
   - `LayerNormNet` is a fully connected neural network with MNIST 28x28 pixel input and 10-class output.  
   - `nn.LayerNorm(128)` is added after the first fully connected layer (`fc1`) to normalize 128 features.  

2. **Dataset**:  
   - MNIST dataset is loaded using `torchvision`, split into 80% training + 20% validation.  
   - Batch size = 64, preprocessing only converts data to tensor.  

3. **LayerNorm layer**:  
   - `nn.LayerNorm(128)`: Normalizes 128 features for each sample.  
   - Training and testing behavior is consistent, unlike BN which requires switching statistics.  

4. **Training and validation**:  
   - Uses Adam optimizer (as described earlier).  
   - Early stopping (`EarlyStopping` class) monitors validation loss and saves the best model.  
   - `model.train()` and `model.eval()` do not affect LN behavior since LN does not rely on batch statistics.  

5. **Example output**:  
```

Epoch 1, Train Loss: 0.3214, Val Loss: 0.1789
Epoch 2, Train Loss: 0.1345, Val Loss: 0.1256
Epoch 3, Train Loss: 0.1012, Val Loss: 0.1087
Epoch 4, Train Loss: 0.0823, Val Loss: 0.1092
Epoch 5, Train Loss: 0.0678, Val Loss: 0.1101
Early stopping triggered!
Restored best model from early stopping.
Test Accuracy: 97.50%

```
Actual results may vary due to random initialization.

### Key Points
- **LN placement**: Usually after linear or convolutional layers and before activation functions.  
- **Batch independence**: LN normalizes each sample independently, suitable for small-batch or single-sample inference.  
- **Learnable parameters**: `nn.LayerNorm` automatically maintains `gamma` and `beta`, which are learned via the optimizer.  
- **Comparison with BN**:  
- LN normalizes feature dimensions, suitable for RNN/Transformer.  
- BN normalizes batch dimensions, suitable for CNN.  

---

### Practical Application Scenarios
- **Transformer models**: LN is a standard component in Transformers (e.g., BERT, GPT), typically used after Multi-Head Attention and Feed-Forward layers.  
- **Sequential tasks**: LN is more stable than BN in models like RNN and LSTM.  
- **Small-batch scenarios**: LN is suitable for online learning or when batch size = 1.  

#### Notes
- **Feature dimension**: `nn.LayerNorm` requires specifying the normalization dimension (e.g., 128) to match the input.  
- **Computation overhead**: LN has slightly higher computation cost than BN for high-dimensional features, but generally negligible.  
- **Combination with other regularization**: Can be used with Dropout, L1/L2 regularization (as described earlier).
