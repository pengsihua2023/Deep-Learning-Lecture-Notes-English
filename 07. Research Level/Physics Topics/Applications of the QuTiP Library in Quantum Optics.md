## Application of QuTiP Library in Quantum Optics
The following is a code example using the QuTiP library, based on real data. This example simulates the Jaynes-Cummings model (a standard model in quantum optics that describes the interaction between a two-level atom and a single-mode cavity field) using the dynamic evolution of vacuum Rabi oscillations. The parameters are sourced from real quantum optics experiments, such as typical values in superconducting circuit QED systems (e.g., cavity frequency wc ≈ 5 GHz, coupling strength g ≈ 100 MHz, decay rate κ ≈ 1 MHz, atomic decay γ ≈ 0.1 MHz, based on experimental data reported in the literature, such as circuit quantum electrodynamics experiments). The code calculates the time evolution of an open system and plots the occupation probabilities of the cavity and atom.

### Complete Code Example
```python
import qutip as qt
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
# Real experimental parameters (based on superconducting QED experiments, units: 2π * Hz)
N = 15 # Cavity Fock state truncation dimension
wc = 2 * np.pi * 5e9 # Cavity frequency ≈ 5 GHz
wa = 2 * np.pi * 5e9 # Atomic frequency ≈ 5 GHz (resonant case)
g = 2 * np.pi * 100e6 # Coupling strength ≈ 100 MHz
kappa = 2 * np.pi * 1e6 # Cavity decay rate ≈ 1 MHz
gamma = 2 * np.pi * 0.1e6 # Atomic decay rate ≈ 0.1 MHz
n_th = 0.01 # Average excitation number of the thermal bath (close to 0 at low temperatures)
# Operator definitions
a = qt.tensor(qt.destroy(N), qt.qeye(2)) # Cavity annihilation operator
sm = qt.tensor(qt.qeye(N), qt.sigmam()) # Atomic lowering operator
sz = qt.tensor(qt.qeye(N), qt.sigmaz()) # Atomic Pauli Z operator
# Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian (using rotating wave approximation)
H = wc * a.dag() * a + (wa / 2) * sz + g * (a.dag() * sm + a * sm.dag())
# Initial state: Atom excited, cavity vacuum
psi0 = qt.tensor(qt.basis(N, 0), qt.basis(2, 0)) # Cavity |0>, Atom |1>
# Time list (units: s, covering several Rabi cycles)
tlist = np.linspace(0, 1e-6, 500) # 0 to 1 μs
# Collapse operators (open system)
c_ops = [
    np.sqrt(kappa * (1 + n_th)) * a, # Cavity decay
    np.sqrt(kappa * n_th) * a.dag(), # Cavity thermal excitation
    np.sqrt(gamma) * sm # Atomic relaxation
]
# Solve the master equation
result = qt.mesolve(H, psi0, tlist, c_ops, [a.dag() * a, sz / 2 + 0.5]) # Expectation values: Cavity photon number, atomic excitation probability
# Plot the results
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 5))
ax.plot(tlist * 1e9, result.expect[0], label='Cavity photon number')
ax.plot(tlist * 1e9, result.expect[1], label='Atom excitation probability')
ax.set_xlabel('Time (ns)')
ax.set_ylabel('Occupation probability')
ax.set_title('Vacuum Rabi Oscillations in Jaynes-Cummings Model')

### Code Explanation
- **Data Source**: Parameters are based on real experiments, such as superconducting circuit quantum electrodynamics (CQED) systems, with values commonly reported in the literature (e.g., Rabi frequency 2g ≈ 200 MHz, decay rates matching experimental measurements).
- **Running Requirements**: Requires installation of QuTiP (pip install qutip). Upon running, it generates an oscillation plot showing the exchange of photons and atomic excited states (Rabi oscillations), which gradually decay due to dissipation.
- **Applications**: This simulation can be used to analyze coherent evolution in quantum optics experiments, consistent with real cavity QED systems.
