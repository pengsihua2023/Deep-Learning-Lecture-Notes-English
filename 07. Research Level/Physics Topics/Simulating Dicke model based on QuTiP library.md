The Dicke Model is a theoretical framework in quantum optics and condensed matter physics that describes the collective interaction between a large number of two-level quantum systems (e.g., atoms or qubits) and a single quantized mode of an electromagnetic field (e.g., a cavity photon mode). It was introduced by Robert H. Dicke in 1954 to study cooperative phenomena like superradiance, where atoms emit light coherently due to their collective coupling to the field.

### Applications
- **Quantum Optics**: Describes atom-cavity interactions in experiments like cavity QED or circuit QED (e.g., superconducting qubits in microwave cavities).
- **Condensed Matter**: Models collective behavior in systems like quantum dots or spin ensembles.
- **Quantum Information**: Relevant for studying quantum entanglement and coherence in multi-qubit systems.
- **Phase Transitions**: Provides insights into quantum critical phenomena and many-body physics.

### Relation to Your Previous Query
The Dicke Model extends the single harmonic oscillator dynamics (as in your QuTiP example) by including multiple two-level systems interacting with the cavity mode. While your example focused on a single coherent state’s decay in an open quantum harmonic oscillator, the Dicke Model considers collective effects, making it relevant for studying cooperative phenomena in similar experimental setups (e.g., superconducting cavities).

If you’d like, I can provide a QuTiP-based code example to simulate the Dicke Model, showing how to compute its dynamics or phase transition behavior, using parameters similar to those in your quantum optics example.
