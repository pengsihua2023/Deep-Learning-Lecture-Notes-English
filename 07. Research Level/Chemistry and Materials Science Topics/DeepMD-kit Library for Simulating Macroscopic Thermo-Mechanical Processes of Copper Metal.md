# DeepMD-kit for Simulating Macroscopic Thermodynamic Processes of Copper Metal
A typical real-data example of using DeepMD-kit in materials science is the simulation of copper (Cu) metal. This example is based on a study of large-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, where a Deep Potential (DP) model is trained using ab initio (first-principles) data and then applied on supercomputers for high-accuracy MD simulations. This approach is suitable for studying thermodynamic properties, defect behavior, and other characteristics of metallic materials.

## üìñ 1. Data Source
- The data originates from an ab initio training dataset generated using a concurrent learning scheme, ensuring uniform accuracy across a wide range of thermodynamic conditions.
- The dataset includes local environment descriptors, energies, and forces for copper atoms, based on quantum mechanical calculations (e.g., DFT), covering relevant configuration spaces.

## üìñ 2. Model Training Process
- Training is implemented using the DeePMD-kit package, typically taking several hours to a week on a single GPU, depending on data complexity.
- The model employs a deep neural network (DNN) to fit high-dimensional functions, incorporating symmetry constraints and concurrent learning to minimize dataset requirements.
- Example command (assuming the data directory is `cu_data`):
  ```
  dp train input.json
  ```
- Example input configuration file `input.json` (simplified, tailored for the copper system, using the `se_a` descriptor):
  ```json
  {
      "model": {
          "type_map": ["Cu"],
          "descriptor": {
              "type": "se_a",
              "rcut": 8.0, // Cutoff radius 8 √Ö
              "rcut_smth": 0.5,
              "sel": [512], // Maximum number of neighbor atoms 512
              "neuron": [32, 64, 128] // Embedding network size
          },
          "fitting_net": {
              "neuron": [240, 240, 240], // Fitting network size
              "resnet_dt": true
          }
      },
      "learning_rate": {
          "type": "exp",
          "start_lr": 0.001,
          "stop_lr": 1e-8
      },
      "loss": {
          "start_pref_e": 0.1,
          "limit_pref_e": 1,
          "start_pref_f": 1000,
          "limit_pref_f": 1
      },
      "training": {
          "systems": ["cu_data"],
          "batch_size": "auto",
          "numb_steps": 1000000
      }
  }
  ```
- Freeze the model after training:
  ```
  dp freeze -o frozen.pb
  ```
