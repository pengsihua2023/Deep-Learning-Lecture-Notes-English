import torch.nn.functional as F
from torch_geometric.nn import GCNConv
from torch_geometric.loader import DataLoader
import numpy as np
from torch_geometric.data import Data

# Simulate QM9 dataset (simplified version)
def create_dummy_molecular_data(n_samples=100):
    dataset = []
    for _ in range(n_samples):
        # Simulate molecular graph: 5 nodes, random edges, features as atom types (assume 1D)
        x = torch.rand(5, 1)  # Node features
        edge_index = torch.tensor([[0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4], [1, 0, 2, 1, 3, 2, 4, 3]], dtype=torch.long)
        y = torch.tensor([np.random.rand()], dtype=torch.float)  # Simulated solubility
        data = Data(x=x, edge_index=edge_index, y=y)
        dataset.append(data)
    return dataset

# Define a simple graph neural network
class GCN(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(GCN, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = GCNConv(1, 16)
        self.conv2 = GCNConv(16, 16)
        self.fc = torch.nn.Linear(16, 1)
    
    def forward(self, data):
        x, edge_index = data.x, data.edge_index
        x = F.relu(self.conv1(x, edge_index))
        x = F.relu(self.conv2(x, edge_index))
        x = x.mean(dim=0)  # Global pooling
        x = self.fc(x)
        return x

# Train the model
def train_gnn(dataset, epochs=50):
    model = GCN()
    optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)
    loader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=10, shuffle=True)
    
    model.train()
    for epoch in range(epochs):
        total_loss = 0
        for batch in loader:
            optimizer.zero_grad()
            out = model(batch)
            loss = F.mse_loss(out, batch.y)
            loss.backward()
            optimizer.step()
            total_loss += loss.item()
        if (epoch + 1) % 10 == 0:
            print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}, Loss: {total_loss/len(loader):.4f}")
    
    return model

# Test the model
def test_gnn(model, dataset):
    model.eval()
    loader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=10)
    total_loss = 0
    with torch.no_grad():
        for batch in loader:
            out = model(batch)
            loss = F.mse_loss(out, batch.y)
            total_loss += loss.item()
    return total_loss / len(loader)

# Main program

    # Generate simulated data
    dataset = create_dummy_molecular_data(100)
    
    # Train the model
    print("Training GNN for molecular property prediction...")
    model = train_gnn(dataset)

### Code Explanation
1. **Task**: Simulate the prediction of molecular solubility using a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to process molecular graph data.
2. **Model**: `GCN` is a two-layer graph convolutional network that aggregates node features from a molecular graph into a global representation to predict properties.
3. **Data**: Uses simulated molecular graph data (5 nodes, random edges); in real scenarios, this can be replaced with chemical datasets like QM9.
4. **Training**: Optimizes mean squared error (MSE) for a regression task.
5. **Testing**: Evaluates the modelâ€™s prediction error on a test set.

### Execution Requirements
- **Dependencies**: Install with `pip install torch torch_geometric`
- **Hardware**: Compatible with CPU or GPU; GPU can accelerate GNN computations.
- **Data**: The code uses simulated data; real applications require actual molecular datasets (e.g., QM9).

### Output Example
Upon running, the program may output:
```
Training GNN for molecular property prediction...
Epoch 10, Loss: 0.1234
Epoch 20, Loss: 0.0987
...
Test Loss: 0.0950
```
(Indicates the modelâ€™s mean squared error in prediction)

### Extensions
