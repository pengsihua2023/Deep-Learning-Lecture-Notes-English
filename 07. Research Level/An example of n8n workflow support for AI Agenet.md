## n8n Workflow Support for AI Agents: An Example
n8n is an open-source workflow automation platform designed for technical teams, combining AI capabilities with business process automation. It allows users to build AI solutions with no-code speed and code flexibility, integrating with any application or API. Since its launch in 2019, n8n has gained rapid popularity, especially in 2025, when it was recognized as a new European unicorn with a valuation exceeding $1 billion. This success is attributed to its innovations in AI agents and automation, such as multi-agent workflows and self-hosting capabilities, making it a preferred tool for developers, IT operations, and AI enthusiasts.

### Detailed Overview of n8n
#### Core Concepts
- **Workflow Automation**: n8n uses nodes to build workflows, where each node represents an action like HTTP requests, database queries, or AI calls. Users can customize workflows via a drag-and-drop interface or code, supporting branching, loops, and error handling.
- **AI Integration**: n8n natively supports AI agent construction, such as using the “AI Agent Tool” node to break complex prompts into focused tasks, supporting multi-agent systems. Users can integrate any LLM (e.g., GPT series) and create tasks or full workflows via chat interfaces (e.g., Slack or voice).
- **Self-Hosting and Cloud Options**: Fully self-hosted (using Docker), including AI models, ensuring data privacy. The cloud version offers convenience, but self-hosting is its core selling point, supporting enterprise-grade deployments.
- **Flexible Development**: Combines visual building with custom code, supporting JavaScript/Python, npm/PyPI libraries, cURL imports, and branch merging. Debugging tools include step-by-step re-runs, data replay, and inline logs.
- **Integration**: Over 500 app integrations (e.g., Salesforce, Zoom, Asana), plus custom nodes. The community provides 1700+ templates covering engineering, document management, and more.

#### Key Features
- **Enterprise-Ready**: SSO (SAML/LDAP), encrypted secret storage, version control, RBAC permissions, audit logs, workflow history, and collaboration tools (e.g., Git integration).
- **Performance and Security**: Self-hosting protects data, supporting white-label automation (maintaining brand identity).
- **Community and Resources**: Active GitHub repository, forums, and tutorials. The community shares cheat sheets (e.g., German/English versions) and templates. In 2025, hackathons (e.g., with GPT-5 integration) and video tutorials were introduced.
- **Use Cases**: Automate customer data management, invoice reminders, Salesforce updates, Asana task creation. Examples: Delivery Hero saves 200 hours monthly, StepStone reduces two weeks of work to 2 hours.

#### Recent Developments (2025)
- **Unicorn Status**: n8n became a new European unicorn in 2025, simplifying workflow automation with AI agents.
- **AI Enhancements**: New nodes like AI Agent Tool support multi-agent systems and GPT-5 integration. Hackathons and tutorials focus on AI agent building.
- **Community Activity**: New cheat sheets, meetups (e.g., n8n community gatherings), and template releases. Users share self-hosting experiences and cost optimization.
- **Competition and Alternatives**: Compared to Zapier and String, n8n emphasizes open-source and self-hosting. In 2025, videos compared its speed and Web3 integration.

#### Pricing
n8n’s core is free and open-source (fair-code license). The cloud version offers a free tier (limited executions) and paid plans starting at $20/month, supporting unlimited workflows. Enterprise editions have custom pricing, including advanced support.

### Code Example
n8n workflows are defined in JSON format and can be imported into the interface. Below is a simple example based on a real use case: fetching news from an RSS feed, summarizing it with AI, and sending it to Slack.

#### JSON Workflow Example
```json
{
  "name": "RSS to AI Summary to Slack",
  "nodes": [
    {
      "parameters": {
        "url": "https://example.com/rss"
      },
      "name": "RSS Feed",
      "type": "n8n-nodes-base.rss",
      "typeVersion": 1,
      "position": [240, 300]
    },
    {
      "parameters": {
        "model": "gpt-4",
        "prompt": "Summarize this article: {{ $json.content }}"
      },
      "name": "AI Summary",
      "type": "n8n-nodes-base.aiAgent",
      "typeVersion": 1,
      "position": [460, 300]
    },
    {
      "parameters": {
        "channel": "#news",
        "text": "{{ $json.summary }}"
      },
      "name": "Send to Slack",
      "type": "n8n-nodes-base.slack",
      "typeVersion": 1,
      "position": [680, 300],
      "credentials": {
        "slackApi": "Your Slack Credentials"
      }
    }
  ],
  "connections": {
    "RSS Feed": {
      "main": [
        [
          {
            "node": "AI Summary",
            "type": "main",
            "index": 0
          }
        ]
      ]
    },
    "AI Summary": {
      "main": [
        [
          {
            "node": "Send to Slack",
            "type": "main",
            "index": 0
          }
        ]
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
**Notes**:  
1. **Import Steps**: Copy the JSON and import it into the n8n interface.  
2. **Run**: Set credentials (Slack API key), activate the workflow. It checks the RSS feed hourly, summarizes content with AI, and sends it to the Slack channel.  
3. **Customization**: Replace URL, model, and channel. Use n8n’s AI Agent node to integrate LLMs.  
More examples are available in the n8n community (https://n8n.io/workflows/) with over 4637+ templates.
