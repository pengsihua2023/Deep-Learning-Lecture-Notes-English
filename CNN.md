## CNN
**Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**

**Importance**: CNNs are the cornerstone of computer vision, widely used in image recognition, autonomous driving, and more, ideal for demonstrating the practical power of deep learning.

**Core Concepts**:  
- CNNs use "convolution" operations, like a "magnifying glass" scanning images to extract features (e.g., edges, shapes).  
- Pooling layers reduce data size, retain key information, and decrease computational load.  
- Fully connected layers are used at the end for classification or prediction.  

**Applications**: Image classification (e.g., cat vs. dog), facial recognition, medical image analysis.
