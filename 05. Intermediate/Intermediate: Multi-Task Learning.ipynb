    "Multi-Task Learning (MTL) is a machine learning training paradigm. The core idea is: one model learns multiple related tasks simultaneously, instead of training a separate model for each task as in traditional methods. The model shares most parameters, each task has a specific output head, and multiple objectives are jointly optimized.  \n",

    "### Code Explanation:\n",
    "1. **Dataset**:\n",
    "   - Uses the UCI Wine Quality dataset (red wine, 1599 samples), containing 11 chemical features and quality scores (3-8).\n",
    "   - Task 1 (Regression): predict the quality score.\n",
    "   - Task 2 (Classification): predict whether it is good wine (quality ≥6).\n",
    "   - Data is loaded via `pandas` from the UCI website, standardized, then split into training set (80%) and test set (20%).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Model Structure**:\n",
    "   - Shared layers: two fully connected layers (ReLU activation), input 11-dim features, hidden size 64.\n",
    "   - Regression head: outputs 1-dimensional quality score.\n",
    "   - Classification head: outputs 1-dimensional binary probability (good/not good).\n",
    "   - Loss function: MSELoss for regression, BCEWithLogitsLoss for classification, joint loss is the sum of both.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Training**:\n",
    "   - Uses Adam optimizer, learning rate 0.01, trains for 100 epochs.\n",
    "   - Prints total loss, regression loss, and classification loss every 20 epochs.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Evaluation and Visualization**:\n",
    "   - Evaluates regression task with Mean Squared Error (MSE) and classification task with accuracy.\n",
    "   - Plots scatter graph showing true vs predicted quality, saved as `wine_quality_prediction.png`.\n",
    "   - Prints the true and predicted values (quality score and classification result) for the first 5 test samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Dependencies**:\n",
    "   - Requires `torch`, `sklearn`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn` (`pip install torch scikit-learn pandas matplotlib seaborn datasets`).\n",
    "   - Dataset is loaded online, no manual download required.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Results:\n",
    "- Outputs training loss during the process.\n",
    "- Test set evaluation:\n",
    "  - Regression task MSE (reflects prediction error of quality score).\n",
    "  - Classification task accuracy (reflects correctness of good/not good classification).\n",
    "- Generates `wine_quality_prediction.png`, showing scatter plot of predicted vs true quality (red line = ideal prediction).\n",
    "- Prints first 5 sample predictions, showing true and predicted quality scores and classification results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes:\n",
    "- Scatter plot is saved in the working directory and can be viewed with an image viewer.\n",
    "- Model is simple (two-layer shared network), suitable for demonstrating MTL concept; in practice, more layers or complex structures can be used.\n"
