    "# Definition  \n",
    "Multi-Task Learning (MTL) is a machine learning training paradigm. The core idea is: a model learns multiple related tasks simultaneously, instead of training a separate model for each task as in traditional methods. The model shares most parameters, each task has a specific output head, and multiple objectives are jointly optimized.  \n",

    "There are three main approaches to mathematical modeling of multi-task learning:\n",

    "1. **Weighted loss function** (simple summation of tasks with weights $\\lambda_t$);  \n",
    "2. **Parameter sharing** (shared layers $\\theta_s$ + task-specific heads $\\theta_t$);  \n",
    "3. **Regularization / probabilistic modeling** (using nuclear norm, graph regularization, or shared priors to model task relationships).  \n",
    "\n",
    "A simplest PyTorch-based Multi-Task Learning (MTL) example uses a real dataset (UCI Wine Quality dataset), implementing two tasks: predicting wine quality (regression task) and predicting whether the wine is good (classification task, quality ≥ 6). Results are shown via visualization (scatter plot of predicted quality) and evaluation metrics (MSE for regression, accuracy for classification).\n"

    "### Code Explanation:\n",
    "1. **Dataset**:\n",
    "   - Use the UCI Wine Quality dataset (red wine, 1599 samples), with 11 chemical features and quality scores (range 3–8).\n",
    "   - Task 1 (Regression): predict quality score.\n",
    "   - Task 2 (Classification): predict whether the wine is good (quality ≥ 6).\n",
    "   - Data is loaded via `pandas` from the UCI website, standardized, and split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Model Structure**:\n",
    "   - Shared layers: two fully connected layers (ReLU activation), 11 input features, 64 hidden units.\n",
    "   - Regression head: outputs 1-dimensional quality score.\n",
    "   - Classification head: outputs 1-dimensional binary probability (good/not good).\n",
    "   - Loss functions: regression uses MSELoss, classification uses BCEWithLogitsLoss, combined loss is the sum of both.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Training**:\n",
    "   - Use Adam optimizer, learning rate 0.01, train for 100 epochs.\n",
    "   - Print total loss, regression loss, and classification loss every 20 epochs.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Evaluation and Visualization**:\n",
    "   - Evaluate regression task with Mean Squared Error (MSE) and classification task with Accuracy.\n",
    "   - Generate scatter plot comparing true vs predicted wine quality, saved as `wine_quality_prediction.png`.\n",
    "   - Print first 5 test samples’ true and predicted values (quality score and classification).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Dependencies**:\n",
    "   - Requires `torch`, `sklearn`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn` (`pip install torch scikit-learn pandas matplotlib seaborn datasets`).\n",
    "   - Dataset is loaded online, no manual download needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Results:\n",
    "- Outputs training
